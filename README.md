# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render, even though the parent route renders correctly. This is often caused by incorrect route definitions or missing elements in the route structure.

## Problem Description

The `App.js` file contains a basic React Router v6 setup with nested routes.  However, despite the routes being defined, navigating to the nested routes results in only the parent route being displayed.  The child components do not appear.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrating proper configuration of nested routes to ensure correct rendering.  The key is ensuring that the `Routes` component is correctly placed within the parent route's element.
